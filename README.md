# The Challenge

Write an application with Vue.js & Vuetify with which you can explore beers from the Punk API. You should be able to search and filter the beers. https://punkapi.com/

Your application has to be as vuetiful as it can be! ;) It does not have to be production-ready code, we would like to see, how beautiful and usable things you can create in a short time period.
